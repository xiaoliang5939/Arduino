## Final Project weekly diary
“Xianbei” weekly diary
## Week 6 
This week I determined the theme I want to do and the macro realistic way.
My work is called "Xianbei". 

This is the name of my cat. She is a British Shorthair cat.I have taken her home since she was born and she is now three years old.After I arrived in the UK, the Xianbei had to stay in Beijing, and I missed her very much.

I want to make a device that allows me to see and hear Xianbei in London. 

First, I thought of making a 3D model that would allow me to touch the Xianbei. However, in terms of material selection, it is impossible to achieve a real cat effect, and at the same time, the cat cannot move smoothly.

One day, I saw a gif of a cat. I think, if you want the cat to move smoothly, maybe you can use cartoons to achieve it.

I thought that I could make a turntable, draw a few coherent movements of cats, and use the motor to drive the turntable to make the animation move.

What kind of trigger is used to turn it?I wanted to do an animation of cats playing, so it occurred to me that I could use a cat toy to trigger the rotation of the mechanism.That is, when the user picks up the cat toy to play with the cat, the device starts to rotate, and the user can see the kitten playing all the time.

At the same time, I think I can add a cat's meow.When the user passes by the device, the Xianbei will make a sound to attract the user's attention.After users are attracted, they will naturally pick up cat toys and play with Xianbei.

I determined my two inputs and two outputs this week.One is a pressure sensor and motor, and the other is an ultrasonic sensor and audio playback.

## Week 7

This week, I drew an animation of the cat based on the appearance of the Xianbei, and cut the animation by laser.
