## Final Project weekly diary
“Xianbei” weekly diary
## Week 6 
This week I determined the theme I want to do and the macro realistic way.
My work is called "Xianbei". 

This is the name of my cat. She is a British Shorthair cat.I have taken her home since she was born and she is now three years old.After I arrived in the UK, the Xianbei had to stay in Beijing, and I missed her very much.
